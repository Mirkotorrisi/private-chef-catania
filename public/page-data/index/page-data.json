He and his staff were extremely accommodating and flexible with my menu requests and the meals were traditional but prepared with his own unique flair. We were treated to complimentary wines chosen by chef Fabio with each course the first night which we enjoyed so much that we added wine to each course for the next two dinners as well.  He and his staff shopped, prepared, served and left an immaculate kitchen after each meal. The Villa was an hour from Catania and quite remote and a bit difficult to access but he took it all in stride. I Canâ€™t say enough about his professionalism, organization and ability to produce such wonderful meals with such attention to detail. But most of all we were so fortunate to have shared his love and passion for food and wine. If you are in need of a personal chef while in Sicily, I can highly recommend chef Fabio. You will not be disappointed!","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105286087827925194126/reviews","author_name":"Nancy Wise","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJiI6kry-RohfQhxY2Z1xzKMXiPRRXsllLTxDu-JVg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo"}},{"node":{"rating":5,"relative_time_description":"7 months ago","text":"We had a BEAUTIFUL meal and local wine pairing from Private Chef Catania. He met with our Air Bnb host before the meal and made sure he had everything he needed to proved a memorable experience for all of us. We all had the best time!\nIt was our first time in Sicily and this experience was both delicious and relaxing. The use of local ingredients and wines was an added touch!

My passion was born in the kitchen at home, during the preparation of Sunday family lunches, using ingredients from all over Sicily. Those same aromas, pleasing to the nose and palate, continue to be a source of inspiration, both to rediscover the ancient flavors and to reinvent myself in new dishes. I was lucky enough to be able to expand my knowledge even outside my country, among the best French and English cuisines. Knowing the beloved native flavors and those of the rest of the world that intrigued me, I was able to invent menus ready to satisfy any palate. My goal is to satisfy these palates, in the intimacy of home, giving rise to the concept of in home chef for you!\n"},"bio_picture":{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/llcdt2fu8790/7b33HJ7b7ye1SL9wuiyIjZ/4eecbda98437267876e5d79d085f9c9c/fusione.jpg"}}},"contentfulRecensioniImmagineAccantoLeRecensioni":{"reviews_image":{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/llcdt2fu8790/7cjoSbqzlV8z7jGyQEJneW/451645382f96821557e0a94f31dbfc0c/WhatsApp_Image_2022-06-01_at_15.28.56.jpeg"}}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
